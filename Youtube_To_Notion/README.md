### Description
This script was mainly designed for times where I was listening to youtube song playlists while working, allowing me to quickly add in songs that I liked to my "Songs Database" Notion. 

The Keyboard Maestro macro is designed to allow me to trigger the python script using a keyboard shortcut instead of the terminal. It also provides a user interface for data entry. **This macro is not required to run the python script, and the python script can run as a standalone script.**
